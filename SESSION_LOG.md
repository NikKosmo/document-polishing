# Session Log

- **2025-12-06 14:20** | `issue` | Found discrepancy between DOCUMENTATION_POLISHING_WORKFLOW.md and implementation - workflow specifies model response field "implementation" (line 222) but code uses "steps" - both represent step-by-step actions, "steps" is more descriptive - **Added to backlog for alignment decision**
- **2025-12-06 14:15** | `completed` | Fixed LLM-as-Judge parsing in `ambiguity_detector.py` - updated `Interpretation.from_response()` to accept already-parsed JSON format from test_results.json (with direct `interpretation`, `steps`, etc. keys), updated `LLMJudgeStrategy._parse_judge_response()` to handle already-parsed judge responses (no longer expects `raw_response` key) - **Result: Judge now correctly compares model interpretations and detects ambiguities**
- **2025-12-06 14:10** | `completed` | Tested Increment 2 with real documentation (`common_rules/todo.md`, 8 sections) - LLM-as-Judge successfully compared interpretations from claude/gemini/codex, found 0 ambiguities (all models agreed with 0.92+ similarity) - **Result: Increment 2 validation complete, system working end-to-end**
- **2025-12-06 13:30** | `started` | Debugging LLM-as-Judge response parsing - discovered `Interpretation.from_response()` expected `raw_response` key but received already-parsed JSON, created `test_judge.py` to isolate and test judge comparison logic
- **2025-12-06 09:40** | `completed` | Ran full polish on `common_rules/todo.md` with all 3 models - 8 sections tested, 24 model queries (3 models × 8 sections), completed in ~12 minutes - **Result: All model responses captured successfully in test_results.json but ambiguity detection failed due to parsing bug**
- **2025-12-06 08:45** | `completed` | Fixed JSON parsing for Claude/Gemini responses - added markdown code block stripping to `model_interface.py` to handle ` ```json ... ``` ` wrapped responses from Claude and Gemini - **Result: Claude and Codex now return parsed JSON successfully**
- **2025-12-06 08:45** | `issue` | Gemini consistently times out after 60s on all prompts - may need increased timeout or prompt simplification - **Added to TODO for investigation**
- **2025-12-06 08:40** | `completed` | Removed default config fallback - script now fails fast with clear error if `config.yaml` not found instead of silently using defaults - **Result: Explicit configuration required, no hidden behavior**
- **2025-12-06 08:35** | `completed` | Added progress logging to workspace - logs written to `workspace/{session_id}/polish.log` with timestamps for each step and section - **Result: Real-time visibility into polish process**
- **2025-12-06 08:30** | `started` | Testing document polishing system with all 3 models (claude, gemini, codex) on `test_simple.md` - investigating JSON parsing issues and Gemini timeouts
- **2025-11-30 20:50** | `completed` | Reorganized project to standard structure - created `scripts/` directory, moved `polish.py` to `scripts/`, moved `src/` to `scripts/src/`, updated CLAUDE.md documentation with new paths and Quick Commands - **Result: Consistent with German/English projects, easy to grab all code for AI chat review**
- **2025-11-30 20:44** | `completed` | Cleanup temp files and project directory - removed `.DS_Store` files (2), `src/__pycache__/` with Python bytecode, typo directory `{src,test,output,config}`, old workspace sessions (3 from Nov 23), and `output/` directory with old test results - **Result: Clean project structure, ready for reorganization**
- **2025-11-23 20:35** | `completed` | Integrated document_polishing into projects structure - created `CLAUDE.md`, `rules/`, `temp/` directories, updated root `CLAUDE.md`
- **2025-11-22 11:51** | `completed` | Created safe version of `model_usage.md` - removed all unsafe options, backed up full version to `model_usage_FULL.md`
- **2025-11-22 11:48** | `completed` | Updated `polish_system/config.yaml` with real CLI tools (claude, gemini, codex) - all 3 models loaded successfully
- **2025-11-22 11:44** | `completed` | Updated `common_rules/model_usage.md` with accurate Claude CLI v2.0.46 documentation - tested stdin, args, JSON output, models, tools
- **2025-11-22 11:39** | `completed` | Updated `common_rules/model_usage.md` with accurate Codex CLI v0.58.0 documentation - tested stdin, args, JSON output, sandbox modes
- **2025-11-22 11:34** | `completed` | Updated `common_rules/model_usage.md` with accurate Gemini CLI v0.16.0 documentation - tested all prompt methods and parameters
- **2025-11-22 11:22** | `blocker` | Discovered `common_rules/model_usage.md` has incorrect CLI usage - shows argument-based prompts but both `gemini` and `codex` accept stdin
- **2025-11-22 11:17** | `in_progress` | Verified CLI tools accept stdin: `gemini` works, `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check` works
- **2025-11-22 11:15** | `blocker` | Found `config.yaml` references deleted mock tools (`./mock_claude`, `./mock_gemini`) - Increment 1 not actually tested with real tools
- **2025-11-22 11:10** | `started` | Investigating Documentation Polishing System - reviewing what's complete vs what needs real tool integration
